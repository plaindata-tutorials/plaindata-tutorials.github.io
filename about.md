The **Plain Data Blog** is all about **Data Engineering**. It focusses on tutorials, best practices and the tools used to deliver absolutely stellar data products and to advance in your Data Engineering career.

This includes **technical topics** such as the particularities of storage, compute and scheduling technologies and also **conceptual topics** such as gathering requirements, designing a data pipeline, a data platform or building a data team.
